Working on the final project came with its fair share of challenges, but it was a great learning experience overall. One of the trickiest parts was getting the program to handle CSV files properly. At first, figuring out how to read from and write to a file was tough, especially making sure the file was updated without erasing existing data. There were also issues with keeping the ArrayList of people in sync with what was in the CSV file, which took some trial and error. On top of that, I had to handle problems like missing files, permission errors, and empty data in a way that wouldn’t crash the program.

Despite the struggles, there were plenty of successes. I was able to get the CSV functionality working so that the program could save and retrieve people’s details without any issues. Once I figured out the bugs, the program could update the list dynamically based on user input and save everything to the file for the next time it ran. Adding solid error handling also made the program more reliable and easier to use.

There were definitely some bumps along the way. At first, the program kept overwriting the CSV file every time it saved new data, but I fixed that by using append mode. I also ran into problems with converting CSV rows into Person objects and vice versa, which caused some messy data until I cleaned up the logic. The program even broke when the CSV file was empty because I forgot to account for that scenario, but adding checks for missing or empty data solved the problem.

In the end, I worked through all the issues by debugging step-by-step and improving how the program handled errors and user input.
